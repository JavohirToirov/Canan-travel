                    Due to the large flows of tourists in 2018, the company began operations under two different trademarks – Gratia Tour (for tourists from Uzbekistan) and Canaan Travel (for foreign tourists). A year later, all three branches of our activities, including the air ticket office, were united under a single brand, Canaan Travel.

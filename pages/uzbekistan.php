                  <h2>Useful Tips</h2>
                  <span>If you are not recognized as a tourist, you can save a lot. In the central markets, it is customary to bargain for every product, except for the simplest, because the East is the East. Sometimes it is more profitable to shop in supermarkets — there you will not encounter a “tourist” trick.</span>
                  <br><br>
                  <span>Use taxi services near airports and train stations only in the most rare case, because the price of such a trip can exceed the real one by two, three, and sometimes even ten times. It is generally much more convenient to use local taxi services, which can be easily found on the Internet.</span>
                  <br><br>
                  <span>In Uzbekistan, it is customary to treat older people with great respect. They are helped on the streets, they give up their seats and are not interrupted in conversation. Another little advice – if you do not need a product or some kind of service, make it clear and clear, otherwise you will not be left behind.</span>
                  <br><br>
                  <span>It is most convenient to exchange currency in banks — there you will find the most acceptable rate.</span>
